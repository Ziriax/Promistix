# Promistix
## A very tiny (100 lines of Javascript code) minimalist Promises/A+ compliant library.

Just written for fun while I was learning Javascript in 2014, so the code is very rough on the edges (sorry Douglas!)

But the nice thing was that [I found a hole in the Promises/A+ spec while doing so, woohoo!](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests/issues/59)

Happy coding,

Peter
