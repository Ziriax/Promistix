# Promistix
## A very tiny (~130 lines of Javascript code) minimalist Promises/A+ compliant library.

Just written for fun while I was learning Javascript in 2014, so the code is very rough on the edges (sorry Douglas!)

But the nice thing was that [I found a hole in the Promises/A+ spec while doing so, woohoo!](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests/issues/59)

In 2016 I optimized it to learn V8 optimization. The included artifical test now runs a tad slower than bluebird (but this is not a fair comparison, as bluebird does so much more)

Happy coding,

Peter
